4. **Transportation**: Provide realistic transportation options including walking paths, bus routes, etc. Include geometry coordinates for mapping routes.

5. **Time Management**: Account for travel time between activities and reasonable durations for each activity.

6. **Variety**: Include a mix of popular attractions and hidden gems appropriate to the user's preferences.

7. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respect local customs and provide appropriate guidance for culturally sensitive areas.

8. **Accommodation**: Suggest real accommodations that match the user's budget and preferences.
